# From Big Data to AI: My Journey to Building a SaaS Studio for the Future

Over two decades ago, I began my career with a simple question: *How can organizations work smarter, not harder, to achieve their goals?*

That question led me down a path of discovery, learning, and innovation—one that began in the classroom. In 2002, I started teaching graduate courses in **Organizational Development, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Management**. It was an exciting time when technology was just beginning to reshape how organizations operated. Concepts like **data warehousing** and **data marts** were emerging, and I saw firsthand how these tools could empower decision-making and improve efficiency.

Fast forward to **2007**, when I transitioned into a leadership role as a ** Non-Managing Assistant Director of a Technology Division** for the State of Kentucky. This was during a transformative era for public sector technology. My team and I consulted on everything from **data collection and warehousing** to **analytics and knowledge management systems**. We worked tirelessly to align technology with organizational goals, fostering cultural change to support **data-driven decision-making** at scale.

But it wasn’t just about the tools—it was about **building a foundation for smarter organizations**. Whether it was creating dashboards to provide real-time insights or designing frameworks to ensure institutional knowledge was accessible, my focus was always on enabling teams to make informed decisions that drove results.

As technology evolved, so did my focus. Over the past several years, I’ve immersed myself in the world of **AI and machine learning**, exploring how these tools can take organizational efficiency and innovation to the next level. The rise of **large language models (LLMs)** and **AI-powered analytics** has opened up new possibilities for automation, knowledge management, and predictive insights.
